            </ul>

            <h2>7. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
            <p>FetchQuest is an independent project developed and maintained by a single developer. It has not
                undergone professional security audits or enterprise-level testing. While care is taken to follow
                security best practices, the service is provided on a best-effort basis.</p>
            <p>FetchQuest is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" without warranties of any kind, either express or
                implied. We do not warrant that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The service will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free</li>
                <li>Data loss will not occur</li>
                <li>The service will meet your specific requirements</li>
                <li>Any defects will be corrected</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>You are responsible for maintaining your own backups of important data.</strong> Use the export
                feature regularly.</p>

            <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, FetchQuest and its operators shall not be liable for any
                indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of
                data, profits, or goodwill, arising from your use of the service.</p>

            <h2>9. Indemnification</h2>
            <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless FetchQuest and its operators from any claims, damages, or
                expenses arising from your use of the service or violation of these Terms.</p>

            <h2>10. Service Modifications</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Modify, suspend, or discontinue the service at any time</li>
                <li>Change features or functionality</li>
                <li>Impose limits on certain features</li>

            <h2>11. Termination</h2>
            <p>You may terminate your account at any time by using the "Delete Account" feature. We may terminate or
                suspend your access immediately, without prior notice, for any reason, including violation of these
                Terms.</p>
            <p>Upon termination, your right to use the service ceases immediately. Provisions that by their nature
                should survive termination will survive.</p>

            <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
            <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with applicable laws, without regard to
                conflict of law principles.</p>

            <h2>13. Changes to Terms</h2>
            <p>We may revise these Terms at any time. We will provide notice of material changes through the service.
                Your continued use after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

            <h2>14. Severability</h2>
            <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue in
                full force and effect.</p>
